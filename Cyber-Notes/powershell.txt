			Get Host = get PS version
			powershell -version 2
	Quick Hitters
		Objects = Properties + Methods
		Properties (attributes) of the Object
		Methods = actions (open + closed)
		{} = code block
		DOS/Bash commands can be used as aliases
		-Persist = save after session
		Key/Subkey --> Properties 
		Pipe sends all the output along the command
			filter at the beginning
		PSDrive = creates drives 
		variables start with a $
		converts right data type to type of left val
		Case insensitive by default
			-eq = maps to == (ieq)
			-ceq = negate
			-ne = not equal
			-gt = greater than
			-ge = greater than or equal to
			-lt = less than
			-le = less than or equal to
			and
			or
			x..y = range inclusion of last val (array/list)
			$x = nothing
			$x++ = works like java
			$x = 1
			$x += <num> = same as python/java
			get-process = ps
			-First = head
			stores output as an array
			single quotes = literal strings
			doube quotes = can be compared
			match = REGEX
			ForEach($something in $variable declared before)
			`n = new line
			@() = force array
			; = continue on the same line
			$true/$false
			try must have a catch but not a finally
			Write-Host can't be piped, Write-Output can be piped
			Updates on your system
			Get-wmiObject -Class 
		Hashes

				over 50 properties
					size limitations
				requires applicable rights to alter
				domain users can read it
			.NET = brackets []
			put() = save
			LSAS = where credentials are stored
		Event logs: .evtx format
		out-gridview
