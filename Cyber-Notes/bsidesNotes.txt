            Rules for breaking rules
                Break a rule a day
                Getting out of trouble is a muscle
                Never break a rule you cannot accept the consequences
                Don't break a rule where someone else pays the consequences
                Tell someone what you are doing
        Stress:
            Embrace it

    5 Things That Matter
        The beginning
            We're still finding our way, butgetting better
            Still havent been replaced by AI
            Top 5 things that matter in security
            "Everything is broken"
            Harder to challenge the norm, make things better
            We are getting better and maturing as an industry
            Not everything is broken
        Basics
            Weka passwords, 2FA, segmentation, app whitelisting
            Not an easy fix and takes time
            Programs designed to try and handle evrything
            See photo
            Windows Firewall, Endpoint logs
            Purchase tools = fix poor programs & lack of leadership
            Executive buy-in, mismanagement and leadership, or infancy in security
            Some further ahead of others
            Collaboration = harder to attack, better practice
        Simuations and Emmulations
            Tools releases are great simulations
            Without, red/blue can't understand each other
            Working through identifying gaps in programs help put priority on what really matters
            Smash & destroy history from pen testers from 10 years ago
            Industry change happened
        Collaboration and Sharing
            Info sharing
            Concerns about crowdsourced TTPs
            Some red teams do their own research and customize tooling to compete
            Research is a good thing
            Releasing tools is a good thing
        Behavior
            Techniques, not tactics and procedures
            Too many false positives
            Allocation of appropriating resources for detection
            Protection takes time 
            Detection vs. Protection
            Visibility is first step
            Must include endpoint logs
            Break out - 1.5 hours
        People, Leadership, & Communication
            Isn't easy
            People are the most important security resource
            Selling ourselves, our value, & strategy isn't easy
            Investments that need to do our jobs is tough
            Tougher when we say no
        If you can't make a change, move on

    History of Least Privilege -Unix
        Basics
